# Event-Countdown-Project

Event Countdown

Event Countdown is a web application designed to track and display countdowns for upcoming events. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can easily:

- Add and manage custom events with specific dates and times
- View real-time countdowns for each event
- Get notifications when an event is approaching

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases my front-end development skills and demonstrates how to manage time-based interactions in a web environment.
